      <p class="preamble">
        My brain gets stuck on music theory in odd ways, and unsurprisingly I
        can't find an app that addresses that <i>exaaaaaact</i> thing. So I keep
        building myself little websites, and I now have enough to put them all
        together for you in a box, in case this is <i>exaaaaaactly</i>
        what you were looking for.

          <h2>reading notes rainbow</h2>

          <p>
            I thought one way I'd improve my sight reading was by seeing the
            same note across multiple octaves on the staff.

          <h2>play a note from a key</h2>

          <p>I struggle to remember where notes go on the cello, but I also only know
            how to play like 4 scales.

          <h2>what note is this?</h2>

            Sight reading, one note at a time.

        <div>
          <h2>what note is next?</h2>

          <p>
            It turns out the alphabet is hard in a second language, and asking
            me "what comes after C" sends my brain in an infinite loop.

            Get random strumming pattern. Strum it. Repeat.
